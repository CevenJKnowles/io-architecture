# IO-II

This directory contains IO-II persona blueprint materials plus scaffolding aligned to repository standards.

## Layout

- `legacy/` — imported historical artifacts (kept largely unchanged)
- `docs/` — curated, standards-aligned documentation
- `runtime/` — runtime/config scaffolding for parity with IO-III where useful
- `tests/` — invariants/tests scaffolding for parity with IO-III where useful
