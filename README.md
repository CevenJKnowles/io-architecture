# IO Persona Blueprint

This repository contains the working material, architecture notes, and documentation related to the evolution of the Io Persona (v1.x series).  
Currently private and used for iterative research + development.

## Governance

Architectural changes that affect runtime, routing, model selection, safety policies, or cross-model behavior require a new ADR in `./ADR/` **before** implementation or doc updates.
